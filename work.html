					<p>To be honest, I have never plan my work field or career path specifically when I just graduated. But one thing I am pretty sure that I want my job can consists of two elements: <b>Problem-solving</b> and <b>Dynamic</b>.</p>
					<blockquote>
					<h4>Part-time Intern<br>DP World - Hong Kong<br>09/2018-05/2019</h4>
						<p>I am very grateful to have this oppotunity to work in DP World, one of the biggest multinational logistics company, as an intern in my final year of study. This is my very first time to work with different people from different background. Colleagues(my bosses) are from all over the world, including UK, France, Dubai, or even Morocco. Working in culturally diversified company has broaden my thinking because they often share ideas and point of views due to different backgorund. Besides, by handling business figures from shipping companies and port operator, I can understand the terminal operator industry development and trend from a busniess perspective. For more details of my intern, go check out my LinkedIn at the bottom of website.</p>

					<blockquote>
					<h4>Terminal Planner<br>Modern Terminals Ltd<br>10/2019-Present</h4>
						<p>Since I am interested in port industry after my internship, I chose to work as a terminal planner after my graduation. I was assgined to handle various projects which allows me to invovle in every level of terminal operation. From terminal layout planning to KPI performance analysis or even land buying negotiation, I am glad to have the oppotunity to understand how a container terminal actually works via joining multiple tasks. Check out my LinkedIn for more.</p>
