					<p>Being an Industrial Engineering student, <b>"Improvement"</b> is one of the biggest keywords in our study. It is what we are striving for in every stage of life. I would say the curriculum offer us an oppotunity of declaring the specialised learning area with high flexibility. Operation Research, Process Engineeering and Cost Engineering are some of the fields that I can truely apply in work. </p>
					<p>I also joined different contests for getting exposed to new experience and getting chance to meet people from various background. Apart from joining contests, I also went to Poland for exchange for one month. History and Language are the two most impressive topics that I learnt in Poland and I further developed some hobbies because of this remarkable journey. I would love to share with you if we can meet. For my competition and exchange details, go check out my CV or visit my LinkedIn at the bottom of website.  </p>
